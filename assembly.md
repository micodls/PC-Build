10. Before completely closing the Intel WiFi chip, bend the top a little bit so that the longer cables have a place to pass thru.

16. Reassemble the triple deck heatsink for the NVME slots.
    * The bottom heatsink should be set aside since it won't fit due to the BCM943602CS and B+M Adapter.
    * Make sure you remove the thermal pad cover for the top part before installing everything back.
    * Tip: Tuck the cables inside the heatsink for better cable management. Just be sure to not bend the cables to much. Hard part is done!

3. Install the rear case fan (exhaust).
   * Case fans should be daisy chained using the PWN Fan splitter.
   * If fans have rgb, they should also be daisy chained using the ARGB splitter/
